### Welcome
This is my first post. From now on, I'll be writing about the things I learn in a daily basis as a Java developer.

I'll try to post here unresolved bugs I found using some library, workarounds, corner cases in a library usage, opinions and reflexions about applications, languages, or designs.

Every post that shows code will have it uploaded to a [github repository](https://github.com/damiancalabresi/blog-post-code).

Let's start here!

{% highlight java %}
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
