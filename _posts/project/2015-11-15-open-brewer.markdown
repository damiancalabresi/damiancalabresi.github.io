####Open Brewer
I'm working in the design of a home beer craft machine. 

The idea is to reach a similar product to others that already exists in the market, but making it's manufacture open source.

It will be based on Arduino components and all the design and instructions will be publicly available to let others create their own machine.

In order to be low cost, this machine will have only a 5 litres capacity.
