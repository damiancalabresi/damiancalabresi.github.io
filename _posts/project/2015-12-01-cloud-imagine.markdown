####Cloud Imagine
The name is just temporary. 

I will develop a cloud service to provide a media processing feature to sites without an API support.
The cost of processing images and videos is so much if it's not taken as it demands. 
In the case of many sites that only have frontend development, outsource this functionality could be really a good option.
